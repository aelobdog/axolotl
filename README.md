# Axolotl 

 __Axolotl__ is a _pseudo -_ programming langauge.

For those of you familiar with markdown, Axolotl is similar to Markdown, but instead of dealing with HTML it deals with numerous other languages.

Axolotl takes it's input in a simplified tag-based syntax and converts it to your language of choice (For now, axolotl can only convert to Java).

You can write code along with Axolotl code as Axolotl has limited functionality and is designed primarily as an educational tool and a utility which helps in the creation of easily readable code in a fast way.

Axolotl is still in it's beta stages.

### Example

```sh
$ cat input
<d] Hello World ! [d>
$ touch output
$ cat output
$ axolotl input output java
Enter name of class   : HelloWorld!                
$ cat output 
```
```Java
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;


class HelloWorld!
{
public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception
{

Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);


System.out.println(" Hello World ! ");

}
}
$ 
```
